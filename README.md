 Performance assessment for C950 DSA II

This program reads in data from multiple CSV files, which include package data, address data, and distance data. Packages are loaded onto trucks manually within the program and a nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to determine a delivery route for each of the three trucks.

There is a textual user interface that allows the user to enter a specific time during the day and see the status of every package at that very moment.
